         The object with commit method. Its "a" property must
         have the same value as its "b" property, so it is not possible
         to restore its state from history since Configurator does not
         try to commit things in this mode.

         Object which presence depends on the state of

         Object which properties can be changed only incrementally.
         One of the properties can be set to a value with differs
         from the value of another property by no more than 1.
         Such an object may be moved to a state from which
         its original state can be restored only by using
         configuration history.
